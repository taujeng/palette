## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

## List of Issues

- [ ] bash: In the context page where data is initialized, there's a Reference Error: localStorage is undefined.
- Possible Solution:
  The issue you're encountering may be related to the fact that the code accessing localStorage is executed on the server side during the initial rendering on the server (for server-side rendering) or during build time (for static site generation), where the localStorage object is not available.
- To avoid this issue, you can wrap the localStorage code in a check to ensure that it's being executed on the client side. You can use the typeof operator to check if localStorage is defined before using it.
